Notes on Exercise 2:

- Counter and counter_mutex are being passed by reference because this will allow allow the
  original value to be updated rather than the copy of the arguments that are made when the 
  threads are created.

  It will take 3 seconds since each thread will take around 1 second and the test will pass if
  there are no race conditions.

  The expectation did not match the output since the output didn't match 3000 and while 
  running the program for couple times the test failed since everytime the result was off
  by few number, for example the first time I ran it was around 2861 and the second time it
  was around 2889 clearly not equal to 3000.

  After inserting the lock_guard inside the for loop the test seem to pass
  but it did take long time since it didn't output the passing test result. It took around
  3 seconds for the test to pass.
  
  Having the lock_guard and the increment operation inside the local scope block did not
  have an impact on the test since the test passed along with taking less time around 1 and
  half second to show the pass test output. This allows the other threads to execute their 
  own critical section code and they don't have to wait since the lock will release as 
  soon as it gets outside the block.

Notes for Exercise 3 DeadLock:

- The concurrency issues in the code is the mutex are not implemented in the 
  right order. Since for the first function increment_counter_vera_1 the 
  lock_guard for mutex_a is before mutex_b but for the second function
  mutex_b is before mutex_a. This might lead to concurrency issue of deadlock.

- When I ran code nothing happened since as I explained it before this code 
  will lead to deadlock and nothing will be executed for this code. Since the
  locks are not used in consistent order leading to deadlock condition.

- I ended up changing the code in the second function where I switched the 
  mutex_a to come before mutex_b to follow the consistency for both the 
  function in this code.
